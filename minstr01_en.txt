\b;Alludo

A basic map for level designers. You can use it as a base to create your own level and share it, if you mention you used Alludo and add me to the credits.

Also, it is a perfect map for testing because of its simplicity and it's easy to modify.

\b;Description

* By default the whole map is flat and there is no water.
* Resources are shown by the color lights. They are in the corners.
* Me and first bots are immortal.
* All building and bots are available.
* There is no alien.

\b;Example modifications

\t;Ground texture

You can change the ground texture by modifying \c;%user%\\terra001.bmp\n; file in the folder where you installed the level. This file must be saved as \c;bmp\n; (24-bit bitmap). You should just save it without changing the format, if your graphics editor has that option.

\b;The End

The game ends when Me dies or TNT is produced, which you can do only by cheats.
